🌫️ AQI Predictor Dashboard

Author: Maryam Zaheer
Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, Machine Learning, TensorFlow, OpenWeather API


📊 Project Overview

The AQI Predictor Dashboard is a comprehensive real-time air quality monitoring and forecasting system that leverages advanced machine learning to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) levels. This production-grade application provides accurate 3-day AQI forecasts, historical trend analysis, and hazardous condition alerts to help users make informed decisions about outdoor activities and health precautions.

🎯 Key Features

· 🔴 Real-time AQI Monitoring - Live air quality data with pollutant breakdown
· 🤖 Multi-Model ML Forecasting - 3-day predictions using XGBoost, LightGBM & LSTM
· 📈 Historical Analysis - 30-day trend visualization and statistical insights
· 🚨 Smart Alert System - Hazardous AQI level notifications with probability scoring
· 🏙️ Multi-City Support - Air quality tracking across multiple locations
· 🔍 Model Explainability - SHAP-based feature importance and model transparency


🛠️ Installation & Local Development

Prerequisites

🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maryam-zaheer08/aqi-predictor.git
   cd aqi-predictor
   ```
2. Set up virtual environment
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv aqi_env
   aqi_env\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv aqi_env
   source aqi_env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
